\
Hi, and thank you for purchasing WEAPONS OF CHOICE "ULTIMATE"\
\
This pack is perfect for Beta or Finished game.\
\
We hope this gently and carefully crafted sample pack will bring you most of your needs for Sound Designing your best Gun scenes.\
\
This sample contains 550 Sounds, classified as following : \
\
AMBIANCES :\
\
	- 4 Ambiances of battleground, one distant with siren, one distant without siren, one close with siren, one close without siren\
\
\
BULLETS :\
\
	- Handling of bullets in canon, in clip, in cylinder, and gunshell. 8 Variations for each.\
	- Impacts on Body, Car, Concrete, Glass, Metal (High and Low), Rock, Water, Windshield and Wood. 10 Variations for each.\
	- Ricochets, to add a bit of excitement during gunfight. 20 variations. \
	- Shell, with sound for large shell, long shell, short shell, and gunshot shell. 15 Variations for each.\
	- Wizz, when bullets are passing over your head. 25 Variations\
\
\
EXPLOSION :\
\
	- Various explosions type, with car (2), debris (4), burst (4), huge (4) and small (4), alongside a building collapsing and a flashbang.\
\
\
GUNS :\
	- 3 Assault rifle\
	- 2 Heavy Machine Gun\
	- 3 Pistols and 2 Revolver\
	- 2 Shotgun\
	- 2 Sniper\
	- 3 Sub Machine Gun\
	- 3 Supressor\
	- Some extra handling including 8 empty gun firing, 8 switching weapon mode and an holster In/Out\
\
\
The gun handling is in each weapon folder and is usually ; Clip Out, Clip In, Cocking, and a sequence of all that.\
The SFX at the end of the name means that it's a one shot sample.\
The LP at the end of the name means that it's a loopable sample.\
Some Automatic weapons (AR, HMG, SMG and Suppressor) have also a burst and a fully automatic sample (30 rounds)\
The rate of firing is 750 rounds per minute, and by pitching it, will let you tune to the right speed to match your project. (Then, remember to pitch the rest of the gun firing to match) (nota : 750 at 0 cents, 1500 at +1200 cents and 375 at -1200 cents)\
Each Weapons have 5 different gun shot and 5 different reverb.\
\
Reverbs type are :\
\
	- Generic : Perfect for large open field or some wide interior space.\
	- Street : Will sounds great in street, but will also work in dense forest or small hills.\
	- Mountains : High Mountains or Canyon will sounds great with this reverb.\
	- Hallway : Perfect for large interior without too much reflexion\
	- Room : Small room with a lot of reflexion.\
\
Of course, you can blend or layer different reverbs as your project need.\
\
\
All sounds are limited at -3dBFS.\
I advise you to start mixing your gunshot with the fader at -6dB, resulting a headroom of -9dB, so that you can seat any elements easily.\
\
